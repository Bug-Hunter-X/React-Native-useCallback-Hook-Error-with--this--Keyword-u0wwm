# React Native useCallback Hook Error with 'this' Keyword

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native: accessing `this` within a memoized function that relies on the component's state or properties. The error typically manifests as `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'state')` or similar.

## Problem

The `useCallback` hook memoizes the function, creating a closure that captures the component's state at the time of creation. If the component re-renders, this captured reference may be stale, leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

## Solution

The solution is to avoid direct use of `this`. Instead, utilize functional updates and dependency injection to manage the component's state and props correctly within the memoized callback.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the error when interacting with the component.

## Fix

See the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected code.  The solution involves using functional state updates and avoiding explicit reliance on `this` within the `useCallback` function.
